# DiamondKata

Here is my attempt at the challenge that was posed in the below repository.

https://github.com/NewDayTechnology/RecruitmentTests/tree/main/DiamondKata

On the whole the exercise took me roughly 1.5 hours, and was quite fun once I had calculated _a_ working approach.

I resisted the temptation to have a look at how others have implemented the solution, this is all from my noggin ;)

I relied heavily on acceptance tests, as I really just wanted to test the public interface of the `DiamondCreator` class.

I used fixture files, as I think this is easier for someone else to visualize _how_ the output should look.

I think the code could benefit from a refactor to tidy things up, but in the spirit of the challenge I am pushing my code 'as-is'.

If I change anything in the future, I intend to log it below:
